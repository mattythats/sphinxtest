# sphinxtest

1-Download and install Sphinx

2-Run sphinx-quickbuilder and seperate your source and build directories

3-Copy the testing folder, index.rst, and conf.py into your source directory

4-Run make html in the directory you ran sphinx-quickbuilder in

5-browse the documentation built in your build directory


The files directory contains cheatsheets I wrote for the PEP8 Python standard as well as a sort of abridged quickstart guide for Sphinx.
